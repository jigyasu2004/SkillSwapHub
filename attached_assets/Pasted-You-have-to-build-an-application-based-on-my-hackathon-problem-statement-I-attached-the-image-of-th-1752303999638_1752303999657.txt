You have to build an application based on my hackathon problem statement. I attached the image of the application what I type I want.
evaluation basis-
● Database design - 35% (if using backend as a service e.g Neon database 15%)
○ Schema Design (well-structured database schema with proper relationships,
data types)
○ Real-time sync (WebSockets, polling etc.)
● Coding Standards- 40%
○ Data Validation - Proper validation of user inputs on both frontend and
backend.
○ Dynamic Values (avoid hardcoding value)
○ Code Reusability – Write modular, reusable components or functions
to avoid repetition and improve maintainability.
○ Performance - App load fast, minimal network calls (using catch
meromry, cookies)
○ Error handling (handles invalid inputs and system errors , fallback
messages)
○ Use a linter on your code to ensure coding standards are followed.
○ Complexity of the code (e.g. nested logic, algorithm use)
● UI/UX Design - 15%
○ Responsive
○ Pagination, breadcrumb
○ Search, Filter
○ Color combination proper (font color is proper with the background color)

problem statement -
Skill Swap Platform
Overview:
Develop a Skill Swap Platform — a mini application that enables users to list their skills and
request others in return
Features:
Basic info: Name, location (optional), profile photo (optional)
List of skills offered
List of skills wanted
Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
User can make their profile public or private.
Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., “Photoshop” or “Excel”)
Request & Accept Swaps:
○ Accept or reject swap offers
○ Show current and pending swap requests
Ratings or feedback after a swap
The user is also able to delete the swap request if it is not accepted.
Admin Role
● Reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions.
● Ban users who violate platform policies.
● Monitor pending, accepted, or cancelled swaps.
● Send platform-wide messages (e.g., feature updates, downtime alerts).
● Download reports of user activity, feedback logs, and swap stats.
